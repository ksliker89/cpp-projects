Understanding the problem:

So as I understood it, I am supposed to write a program that
finds the max and min of every integral type. That is: int, 
short, and long. I'm supposed to calculate this max and min 
for both signed and unsigned numbers in these data types.


Devising a plan:

In the problem set it asks that we use sizeof() and pow().
These two predefined functions are held in their perspective
libraries. That is where I started my program. #include <needed_libraries>
After that I declared all the variables that I would need and then 
initialized them. My plan overall was just to start out using the 
macro's and then using my knowledge of base-two numbers to 
calculate the max and min using pow() but paying attention 
to my signed bits. 


Testing:

For testing I basically did not wait until the last line of code
to start breaking down the inputs and computations. After each 
variable declaration and input I would simultaneously output the 
variable to ensure the right numbers were in their perspective
variable names. Then after all the computations (which I checked
with a calculator) I would output the variable/result. 
This was a great way to test my code efficiently and completely.
